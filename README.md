## Getting Started

To make things a lot easier to set up, ensure that you have the ComfyUI manager installed. This will allow you to install any missing nodes easily by navigating into the manager and selecting `Install Missing Custom Nodes`
- drag the desired workflow into the ComfyUI interface
- selecting the missing nodes from the list
- head into the ComfyUI Commandline/Terminal and Ctrl+C to shut down the application
- start ComfyUI back up and the software should now have the missing node
- note, some workflows may need you to also download models specific to their workflows... I'll try to leave info on this if necessary

The ComfyUI manager can be install from this repo:
`https://github.com/ltdrdata/ComfyUI-Manager`
To install the manager simply:
- navigate into the custom nodes directory `ComfyUI/custom_nodes`
- `git clone https://github.com/ltdrdata/ComfyUI-Manager.git` in your commandline or terminal. 

## Workflow List

Here is a list of the available workflows:

### Frame Interpolation
![Basic Frame Interpolation Output](./assets/frame_interpolation/00/output.gif)
- [Frame Interpolation Between Two Images](./assets/frame_interpolation/00/basic_first_last_interpolation.json) - This workflow is a basic introduction to blending between two different frames. This will be expanded on heavily but to get everyone started, I am beginning with this basic yet extremely powerful workflow.
